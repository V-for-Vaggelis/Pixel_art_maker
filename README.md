# Pixel_art_maker
The pixel art maker is a drawing-canvas website developed by using html, CSS, javascript and jquery, designed for desktop devices with the purpose of giving the user the ability to draw by clicking on small boxes.
The user is able to create a grid where he can paint by picking different colors.
It is also styled with a unique star wars theme.

## Instructions
<ol>
<li>Create a grid by clicking on the "Create force filed" button (You can also change the size of the grid using the equivalent fields). </li>
<li>Select a color by clicking on the initially red box</li>
<li>Paint by clicking on a box</li>
</ol>

#### Extra functionalities
in the spirit of practicing my javascript and jquery skills I have added some extra possibilities for the user:
<ol>
<li>Check the eraser button to correct your drawing **(important: uncheck the button once you're donein order to keep painting)**</li>
<li>You can paint continuously by dragging the mouse</li>
<li>Use the "Clear Force field" button to delete any current painting from the grid</li>
<li>Use the "toggle grid" button to make the cell-borders invisible. Press it again to make them re-appear</li>
<li>Select one of your 5 previously used colors by right-clicking on the grid</li>
</ol>

## Compatibility
As mentioned above this website is not responsive and it will probably only display properly on desktop devices, because the purpose of this project was purely to practice javascript and jquery skills.
As for different web browsers, the website was only tested for "Google chrome" and "Mozilla Firefox" but it should work on any browser. If not please report any issues.
